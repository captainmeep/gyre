# GYRE

A design tool for creating kinetic wooden clocks and sculptures composed of multiple rotating panels with carved negative space.

## Concept

GYRE helps you design layered panel assemblies where each panel rotates on a shared axis at its own cycle rate. By assigning prime-based rotation periods to each panel, their carved cutouts align in mathematically predictable but visually complex patterns — a physical manifestation of modular arithmetic.

## Features

- Compose geometric cutout patterns on individual panels
- Assign independent rotation cycles (prime bases) to each panel
- Visualize composite overlap across keyframes to explore alignment moments
- Export panel designs as SVG/DXF for CNC fabrication

## Workflow

1. Design panels with geometric negative space
2. Configure rotation cycles per panel
3. Scrub through positions to find compelling alignments
4. Export individual panels for CNC routing, finish by hand
